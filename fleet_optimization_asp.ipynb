    "## 1. Problem description, dataset selection\n",
    "\n",
    "In a highly influential work by Hane et al. (1995), the \"fleet assignment problem\", which is about determining which _type of aircraft_ to assign to which flight, is presented alongside a possible solution. The problem is multifaceted as it is based on several variables, including profit, aircraft specifications and travel demand. Overall, it can be regarded as an optimization problem since it aims at determining the the most cost-effective and efficient way of assigning aircrafts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Current research focuses on discovering new ways of solving this problem, i.e. through machine learning algorithms. Multiple attempts to solve variations of this problem have already been published, for example by Grönkvist (2005) who tackled the \"tail assignment problem\" of assigning _individual aircraft_ to flights. According to Barlow (2019), the airline scheduling problem still has not been solved completely (as of 4 years ago).\n",
    "\n",
    "The used data was taken from Clarke (2012). Another example case was published by Belobaba (2014). Incidentally, the data tables of the latter example case are presented in basically the same exact structure, meaning that our guess and check program would also work for it - just the hard-coded registrations in the section \"Count the number of flights on a route per aircraft\" would have to be changed (and the data would have to be changed out, of course).\n",
    "\n",
    "To use our code, no additional files need to be present apart from this notebook, as the .lp files can be generated by the code. Nevertheless, we included all of the generated files in the submission.\n",

    "## 2. Problem representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the requirements of the original task description into account, the given data was encoded in the following tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Table 1 - Flight*: A key aspect here is considering the need for return trips and departure times: every aircraft must return to its origin airport upon returning from a destination, meaning that each aircraft will appear in the schedule at least twice. To account for this, the route number for each origin-destination pair was added with the same route number being used for both directions of travel. This allows for clear identification and tracking of each aircraft's journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Table2 - Aircraft*: This table provides information about the different types of aircrafts available in the fleet, their quantity, capacity and operating cost for flights between Salt Lake City & Atlanta, and Salt Lake City & Phoenix.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Table3 - Profit*: This table lays out information about the profit generated by using different types of aircrafts for different flights. This information will later be used throughout the entire logic program, as it is essential to maximize the profit in the optimization step.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Table 4: Fleet*: Additionally, a fleet table including a made-up registration number for each individual aircraft was added. This allows for easy identification and tracking of the respective aircraft being used for each flight and is closer to real-life operational planning than an abstract type-based schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "These tables provide the input data that will be used in the subsequent step, namely the logic program. These changes to the problem representation will ensure that all necessary information is captured and considered when creating the aircrafts' daily schedule and calculating the profit. "

Of course, no schedule could ever be created this way as the resulting flight sequences would in many cases be physically impossible, but this comparison is interesting as it allows to estimate the \"loss\" caused by operational circumstances and constraints on the final schedule. The difference between this profit sum and the actual profit of the final schedule gives an indication of how much profit is lost due to the imposed constraints."
